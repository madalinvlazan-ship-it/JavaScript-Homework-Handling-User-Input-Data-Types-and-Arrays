    <h1>JavaScript Homework Handling User Input, Data Types, and Arrays</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>
        ObjectiveCreate a program that collects and processes student
        information using functions and arrays. This exercise will test your
        understanding of functions, data types, user input, arrays, and simple
        data manipulation.
      </h2>
      <ol>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <li>
          Define a function getUserInfo that: Asks the user for their name using
          prompt. Asks the user for their age using prompt. Asks the user if
          they are present using confirm. Returns an object containing: name:
          the user's name. age: the user's age (as a number). attendance: a
          boolean indicating whether the student is present.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use this function to collect data for multiple students and store
          their information in an array.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a function showAttendancePercentage that: Calculates the
          percentage of students who are present. Displays this percentage in an
          alert.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a function createTeams that: Takes a number as a parameter (the
          desired number of teams). Forms teams only with present students.
          Distributes students across the teams in a structured way so that each
          team receives students in a cyclic order. Shuffles the students before
          assigning them to teams to ensure variety. For 10 present students and
          3 teams required, logs in the console the teams in the following
          format: TEAM 1 Student 1 Student 4 Student 7 Student 10 TEAM 2 Student
          2 Student 5 Student 8 TEAM 3 Student 3 Student 6 Student 9 Push your
          work to a personal Git repository and share the link to your
          repository.
